title: Qualitative Methods for First Order Equations
---

We started discussion of basic qualitative and graphical methods for first order
equations. This included the idea of making and studying a _slope field_.
And for the case of an _autonomous_ equation \\(y' = f(y)\\) we saw how to
make a _vector field_ to study solutions.

And because it came up and seemed appropriate, I talked just a little about
what the word "bifurcation" means, and how understanding what happens to your
model when you vary the parameters can be really important.

### For Wednesday

Practice on some equations. Make slope fields. Try the "vector field in 1 dimension"
approach.

### For Friday

We will have our first exam in class. This will focus on the following topics:

  - basic modeling ideas
  - techniques for finding analytic solutions to first order equations
