title: Sublimation Day 3&colon; SageMath Basics and Linear Algebra of Curve fitting
---

We are discussing the basics of fitting a model curve to a collection of data points.
Since my major tool is SageMathCloud, we spent some time talking about how to
handle the basic system management tasks in SMC.

Then we moved on to some discussion of the underlying geometry of curve fitting.
The most successful way to handle curve fitting is to turn your problem into
an "unsolvable" linear algebra problem, and then stare hard at the picture
of the column space. I drew the pictures that go with this and talked briefly about
how this ends up being exactly the "least square error" method.

Along the way, I told a short version of a story about Gauss and predicting the
orbit of Ceres. If you want to know more about that story, do a short Google search
for "Gauss Ceres" and you will find lots of information.

By the way, knowing how to handle differential equations and deal with data has
helped humanity achieve some amazing things. [For example, this.](https://vimeo.com/120587613)

### About the assignment

I think that learning to fit a model to data is pretty important, so I am happy to
spend time on just that. To give you a little more time to finish up the current project,
I will push the due date back to the end of the work day on Tuesday, September 6.
I would very much like to do something else on Wednesday and Friday next week.


### About the last assignment

You did a decent job on the first written assignment, so I wanted to share it with the class.
