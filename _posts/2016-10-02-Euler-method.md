title: Euler's Method
---

We discussed the basics of Euler's method. This included

  - the simple graphical reasoning the motivates it (using a slope field),
  - the connection to the left-hand Riemann sum method for numerical integraion
  - the connection to a "\\(0\\)th order Taylor Series approximation to \\(f(x,y(x))\\)."

In class, I opened Sage and we implemented Euler's method with a simple python/sage
script. We used this to study the IVP \\(y' = y^2, y(1)=2\\) from a previous meeting.
