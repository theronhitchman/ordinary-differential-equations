title: The Matrix Exponential
---

I introduced the idea of an exponential function that takes in square matrices and
returns square matrices. This has several useful properties that will make it
helpful for solving _linear_ systems of odes.

The key is to mimic the usual power series definition of \\(e^x\\), because
that will only require multiplication and addition (...and a limiting process).
Those are things that make sense for square matrices!
