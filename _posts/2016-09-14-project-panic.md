title: Project Discussion Day

I returned your warm-up projects on Sublimation of Dry Ice with comments. We talked
about how since this was a project to _compare_ things, a summary table and a
combined set of plots would be useful.

Then we took some time to discuss the Oil Slick project in small groups. I think we
came around to this: we have the type of area (\\(A\\)) data that would allow us to estimate
\\(\Delta A / \Delta t \\) at several times. But since we don't have the corresponding
times, our only option is to plot \\(\Delta A / \Delta t\\) against \\(A\\).
That plot should be a place to start our real analysis.

I also made an outline of the semester on the chalkboard while you were working.
Here are my pictures.
