title: Picard Iteration
---

Today we discussed power series methods and Picard Iteration. I started by showing
_my_ work on the example I asked you to try.

Then we talked through the idea of Picard Iteration again, and we looked at the
same example with this technique.

You can find the [SageMathCloud worksheet we used here.][wksht]

### For Friday

We will not meet. Please enjoy the day off. Maybe do some reading and practicing
about power series methods and Picard Iteration. It is easy: pick some equations
and try the techniques.
