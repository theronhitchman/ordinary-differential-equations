title: Using the Matrix Exponential on Systems
---

Today I showed how you can use the matrix exponential function to solve systems of
the form \\(\dfrac{dX}{dt} = AX\\), that is, constant coefficient homogeneous
linear systems of first order differential equations.

Then we took a peak at how it might apply to non-constant coefficient set-ups
\\( \dfrac{dX}{dt} = A(t)X\\), and saw that the failure (in general) of commutativity
for matrix multiplication is a problem.
