title: Motivating the Matrix Exponential
---

Today I showed you how to see that the matrix exponential function is really
going to be the thing we need to solve equations of the form \\(x' = Ax \\) where
\\(A\\) is a constant matrix and \\(x=x(t)\\) is a vector-valued function.

I will write up my solutions to the homework for today and send a link to a SageMathCloud
worksheet via email.

#### For Wednesday, 21 October

Compute the matrix exponential \\(e^{tA}\\) for each of these matrices \\(A\\):

1. \\( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \\)
2. \\( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\)
3. \\( A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\)

In each case, write down a system of linear equations \\(x' = Ax\\) and see what
the solution says. Can you see a _single_ ordinary differential equation of higher
order which corresponds to each equation? What do you learn about the solutions
to those equations?
