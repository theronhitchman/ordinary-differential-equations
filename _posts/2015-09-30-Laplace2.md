title: Laplace Transforms, continued
---

Today we grappled with more Laplace Transform methods to solve simple ODEs.
What can be ugly here is that the algebra gets out of control. Real mastery of
Laplace Transform technique requires a lot of facility with algebraic
manipulation---in particular, one has to be comfortable with partial fraction
decompositions.

We did see the very useful "Shifting" formula for Laplace Transforms, too.
If \\(F(p)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(f(x)\\), then
\\[
\mathcal{L}[e^{ax}f(x)] = F(p-a).
\\]
We found this to be helpful from right to left! That is, we can often recognize
our Laplace transform as a shift of the Laplace transform of a known function
(off the table, say), so then the formula helps us work back towards the input
function.

#### Reminder: Exam Friday

topics: numerical methods, picard iteration, analytic techniques for first order
equations.

(no Laplace Transforms)
