title: Differential Form and Exact equations
---

I discussed how to think about differential equations written in "differential form"
\\[  M(x,y)\ dx + N(x,y)\ dy = 0 \\]
provided they satisfy a necessary condition:
\\(\dfrac{\partial M}{\partial y} =\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial x} \\)

The procedure is pretty simple, it is the overarching geometric picture which I
find more challenging.

### For Wednesday

Find some equations in differential form and practice these two things:

1. checking that the equation is exact
2. solving the equation with a pair of integrations, provided that it is exact.

Start your project! It is in your email.
