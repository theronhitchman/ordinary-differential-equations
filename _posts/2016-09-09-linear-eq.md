title: First Order Linear Equations
---

I lectured on the method of solution for linear equations of the first order.
It turns out that for something of the form
\\[ y' + P(x) y = Q(x) \\]
the method is "simple." Multiply through by the function \\(e^{\int P(x)\ dx} \\)
and then integrate.

I tried to show how this is something one might stumble on, because it is mysterious
when said like that. In the end, the "big trick" is to use the product rule in reverse:
\\[  e^{\int P} y' + e^{\int P} P y = \dfrac{d}{dx} \left( e^{\int P} y\right) \\]

We also talked a bit about how even the simple equation \\(y' = y\\) shows an
interesting feature of mathematics: We didn't originally have a function which solves
that equation. What we really did was to give a name to the solution function ( \\(e^x\\) )
and then go study the properties of that function to make us more comfortable.
This happens again when we try to solve the equation \\( y' = 1/x \\) and the equation
\\( y'' + y = 0\\).

If you ever get lost in the woods, use this strategy. Just build a house. Now you
live there! You will have significantly improved your predicament.

### For Monday

Do some more reading. Also, find some practice equations in one of the sources I gave
you. You should be able to solve separable equations and linear equations by the end of
next week.
