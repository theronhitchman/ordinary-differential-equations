I discussed how one transitions from studying one equation of the first order,
to the more general problem of studying several equations of any (finite) order.
It turns out that the most general problems we need to consider are of this form:
\\[
\dfrac{dX}{dt} = F(X,t), \quad X(0) = X_0
\\]
where everything is now vector-valued.

We can also trade out that independent variable and write this in an autonomous
form if we allow for one more dimesion in our vectors. We will sometimes do this,
and sometimes not.
