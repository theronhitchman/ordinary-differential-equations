title: The Jordan Canonical Form, exemplified
---

Today I used one of your homework exercises to give an example of how to construct
a decent basis for a matrix which is _not_ diagonalizable. The end result is
a thing called the **Jordan Canonical Form** of the matrix.

There was no homework assigned, except maybe to reread something about the JCF.
