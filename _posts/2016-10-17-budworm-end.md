title: Budworm Finale
---

We finished our discussion of the spruce budworm model, by looking carefully at the
surface which described the possible steady states for each pair of (dimensionless)
parameters.

This shows a lot of interesting phenomena! For one, you can see a "bifurcation" where
one stable point might split into two stable points as a parameter changes.
