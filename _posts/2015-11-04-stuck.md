title: Stuck on Systems

We discussed the two homework exercises for today. For the first task, we got
pretty far along, but then we need to be careful in the spot where our eigenvalues
might be negative.

To fix the ideas a bit, please reconsider this exercise in the following special
cases:

  * \\( \beta = 3, k = 2\\)
  * \\( \beta = 4, k = 3\\)
  * \\( \beta = -4, k = 5\\)

In each of those cases, please find the complete solution explicitly, and then
make plots of these solutions so that you can understand them.

Then we started talking about the second exercise. You are all stuck. I suggest
comparing with the way we solved a single variable ODE of the form
\\[ y' = ay + f(t) \\]
