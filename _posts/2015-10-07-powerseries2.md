title: More about Power Series Methods
---

We spent a significant amount of time today on checking through the homework
assignment. A few times through the process and you get a feel for it. You
also learn how long it can take to use this technique. If you enjoy computing
(like I do), this is fun. Other people probably find this tedious.

Anyway, I started talking about some definitions. I defined what it means for a
point to be an "ordinary point" of an equation of the form

\\[ y'' + P(x) y' + Q(x) y = 0 \\]

This involves the idea of an "analytic function." Since that was a new concept
for many of you, we talked about that for a bit.

Next time, we will discuss what it means to have a singular point, and the
difference between a "regular singular point" and an "irregular singular point."
Then we will look at a motivating example: Euler's equation. This should set us
up for the general technique called "The method of Froebenius."
