title: Runge-Kutta numerical method
---

We discussed the industry standard basic numerical approximation method, called
Runge-Kutta (or sometimes just RK45). We talked about several important features:
the geometry; the relationship to Simpson's Method of numerical integration;
local and global error estimates.
