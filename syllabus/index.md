### Learning Objectives

Students will learn to

1. use numerical methods to approximation solutions to differential equations.

2. use a variety of standard techniques to solve equations analytically, including the theory of linear systems of equations with constant coefficients.

3. use geometric models for thinking of several different kinds.

4. communicate clearly about mathematics using precision and concision.

5. Ask reasonable questions about where to direct further learning.

### Assessment:

Course grades will be based on regular classroom participation, two midterm examinations and a final project and paper.
