title: The Laplace Transform, Part 2
---

I gave a lecture with examples of how to use the Laplace Transform to solve
certain ordinary differential equations. We started with a really easy one to
make sure we did it correctly. Then we solved a second order linear equation.
(woo-hoo! second order!) I finished by sharing some special properties of the
Laplace Transform which are useful to know about, and then I read a short biography
of Laplace aloud because it made me laugh.
