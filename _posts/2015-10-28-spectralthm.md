title: The Spectral Theorem
---

Today we talked about how we can design matrices with desired eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

Then I briefly introduced the _Spectral Theorem for real symmetric matrices_.

Finally, I introduced the idea of the Jordan Canonical Form.

#### For Friday, 30 October

1. Read up on the Jordan Canonical Form.
2. Figure out how to diagonalize this real symmetric matrix:
\\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}
\\]
3. Figure out as much as you can about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this
matrix:
\\[
B = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 3 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
\\]
