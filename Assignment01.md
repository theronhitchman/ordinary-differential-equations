#### Math 3425 Ordinary Differential Equations, Fall 2015
# Assignment \#1

For Wednesday, August 26:

1. Find some examples of differential equations you care about.

    Choose at least one equation that you do not know how to solve.
    * What do you know about this equation?
    * What situation does the equation model?
    * What do the terms represent?
    * Can you determine the _order_ of the equation? Is it a _system_?
      Is the equation _autonomous_? Is the equation an _ordinary_ differential
      equation, or a _partial_ differential equation?

 Be prepared to share your example with the class on Wednesday.

2. Find some information on **Euler's Method** and read up on it. This is the
    simplest numerical scheme for finding approximate solutions to a differential
    equation. To ground your reading, it will help to try to do something simple
    with it. Here are two simple tasks to work on.

    A. Do you see the geometry behind Euler's method? Can you draw a schematic
      representing what the method does?

    B. Try to use Euler's method **by hand** to find a simple approximation to a
      solution to this _initial value problem_:

      $$ y' - y + 1 = 0, \qquad y(0) = 1. $$

      Use only three or four steps, and try to find an approximate solution which
      exists on the interval $[0,1]$.
