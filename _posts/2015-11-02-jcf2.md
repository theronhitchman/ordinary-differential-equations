title: How to use the JCF
---

Today we talked about how to use the Jordan Canonical Form to simplify a computation
with the matrix exponential function.

The key observation is that if \\(J\\) is a matrix in Jordan block form,
corresponding to a (generalized) eigenvalue \\(\lambda\\), then we can write
\\[
J = \lambda I + (J - \lambda I)
\\]
Now those two matrices on the right _commute_, so we can use the property that
\\(e^J = e^{\lambda I + (J-\lambda I)} = e^{\lambda I} e^{J-\lambda I}\\)
and also the fact that the matrix \\(J - \lambda I\\) is _nilpotent, so its
exponential will be a polynomial!

1. There is another tweak to be worked out if the matrix has complex eigenvalues.
About the simplest non-trivial case I can think of is the idea of a _damped
harmonic oscillator_, like a spring suspended in maple syrup. Use our techniques
(and similar ideas) to work out this equation:
\\[
x'' = -k x - \beta x'
\\]

2. So far, we have only talked about _homogeneous_ equations: \\(X' = AX \\).
Mix the tools we have developed and solve this system:
\\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
x_1' & = & 2x_1 & - & x_2 & + & x_3 & + & 1 \\
x_2' & = & x_1 &  &  & + & x_3 & + & e^t \\
x_3' & = & x_1 & - & 2x_2 & + & x_3 & + & e^{-t} \\
\\]
