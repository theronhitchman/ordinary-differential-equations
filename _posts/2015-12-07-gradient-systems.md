title: Cycles, and Gradient Systems
---

Today we discussed the idea of a cycle. Then we talked about realizing a system
as a "gradient system" to show that cycles don't exist.

#### For Wednesday, 9 September

1. Let's characterize gradient systems. We will use the generic system
\\[
 \left\\{ \begin{array}{ccc} x' & = & f(x,y) \\\\ y' & = & g(x,y) \end{array}\right.
\\]

  * Suppose that \\(\star\\) is a gradient system. Show that
  \\[ \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} =\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x} \\]

  * Suppose that
  \\[ \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} =\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x} \\]
  Use our techniques from earlier in the term to construct a potential function
  \\(V\\) which realizes \\(\star\\) is a gradient system.
