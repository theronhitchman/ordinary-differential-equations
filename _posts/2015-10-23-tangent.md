title: A Long Tangent
---

I got distracted today and told you a story about why the matrix
\\( \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\) is my favorite. This is
a fun story with lots of interesting mathematics in it, and we need a little
break from the pace of the semester, so I regret nothing.
