### Learning Objectives

Students will learn to

1. model situations involving change using differential equations.

2. use a variety of standard techniques to solve equations analytically, including the theory of linear systems of equations with constant coefficients.

3. use geometric models of several different kinds to do qualitative analysis.

4. use numerical methods to approximation solutions to differential equations.

5. communicate clearly about mathematics using precision and concision.


### Assessment:

Course grades will be based on six assessments: three exams (2 midterm and 1 final)
and three projects. Each of these will involve multiple learning objectives.

Assessment items will be well-described in advance, including specifications for
constitutes acceptable work. Work that does not meet standards will be given one
one chance for revision in a time frame negotiated with the instructor.

### Dates to Watch:

* Fourth Week of Class: Project 1
* Fifth Week of Class: Exam 1
* Ninth Week of Class: Project 2
* Tenth Week of Class: Exam 2
* Final Exam Week: Final Exam and Final Project
