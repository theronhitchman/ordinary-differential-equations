title: First Meeting

---

Welcome! This will be our class blog. We had a productive first meeting, and I am happy to have met you all.

We will work on a variety of things this term, but these three are the main things I will keep in mind as I make decisions:

1. Gaining independence as a learner and mathematician. In our context, this means learning how to find what you need to know, and figuring out _what is my next question? what do I study next?_
2. I want this course to be responsive to your needs and interests, so the other side of (1.) is that you should tell me what you think is interesting and important to know next for you.
3. Making Models for thinking, especially geometric models for understanding differential equations.

You guys work hard, and we will go as far as we can.
