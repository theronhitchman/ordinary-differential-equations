title: Linearization
---

Today we discussed how to linearize a 2d autonomous system in the neighborhood of
a fixed point. The main tool is Taylor's theorem, in a vector calculus form.

We looked at a pair of examples to see how to do the technique.

#### For Friday, 4 December

Linearize and classify all of the fixed points in the three examples you studied
for today!
