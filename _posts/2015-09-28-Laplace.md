title: The Laplace Transform for ODEs

---

We discussed how to use the Laplace transform method to find solutions to
initial value problems. The key properties of the Laplace transform we need
are these:

1. It is linear
2. if \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous functions such that
\\( \mathcal{L}[f] = \mathcal{L}[g] \\), then \\(f = g \\).

We worked a generic example, and then a specific one. Then you got a chance
to practice on your own on an equation we could solve another way. We checked
our work by comparing results of the two methods.

I sent a short homework assignment for Wednesday by email.

##### Reminder: Exam Friday in Class

topics: numerical methods, picard iteration, analytic methods for first order
equations.
