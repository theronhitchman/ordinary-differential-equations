title: Qualitative Analysis in Two Dimensions
---

We started discussion of qualitative analysis for two variable systems of ordinary
differential equations. Again, they must be autonomous. The new words we need are:
_phase plane_, _vector field_, _integral curve_, _fixed point_.

We want to understand the simplest systems first, so we took up the qualitative
behavior of linear systems in 2d. We introduced the trace-determinant plane, and
showed how that helps us organize the eigenvalue information that will describe
how things work. We started looking into several special cases, including
one where we do not have an isolated fixed point at the origin, and another where
the origin is a "stable node."
