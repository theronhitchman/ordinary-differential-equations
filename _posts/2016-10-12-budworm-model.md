title: The Budworm Outbreak Model
---

We discussed an official version of a model for the spruce budworm outbreak
that comes from the literature. This is a famous example.

Keys:

  - designing a "predation term" to fit an "S" shape.
  - understanding the roles of our parameters
  - understanding the units of each quantity in question
  - reconfiguring the model to use an equation between _dimensionless quantities_.
