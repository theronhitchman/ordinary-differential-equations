title: Sublimation, Day 1
---

We started with a talk about class structure and materials. More details
(syllabus and list of resources) ASAP.

Then we discussed modeling an experiment involving the sublimation of dry ice
(which is just frozen carbon dioxide). We learned a bunch of new words:

  * initial value problem, initial condition, separable equation

and I hinted at the existence of mysterious mathematica objects called "differential
forms." (spooky voice there)

We talked about common chemistry models called "rate laws" which look like this:

\\[ m'(t) = -k (m(t))^r \\]

You probably noted that Treasure kept saying "the negative rate is..." where I
always put the negative sign on the other side of the equation. This is just a
cultural difference between mathematicians and chemists.

Anyway, my favorite achievements for the day were these:

  * You did really great work in the "pre-model brainstorm" phase where you
  looked for assumptions and expectations.
  * We got to solve some differential equations! We used the general technique
  for separable equations, and worked in more detail for the cases of
  \\(r=0,1,2\\).

### For Monday

1. Please use the data to finish constructing models for the cases \\(r=0,1,2\\).
Which one fits best? How do you know? (I'll send you a way to get the data shortly.)

2. We talked about how maybe what should _really_ matter is the surface area. What
choice of order \\(r\\) should that lead us to use? \\(r=0,1,2\\) or something else?
How can you decide? Come up  with a way to choose and be ready to argue for it.
