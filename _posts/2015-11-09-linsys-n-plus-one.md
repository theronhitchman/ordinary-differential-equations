title: More Linear Systems

You all discussed our approaches to these sample equations. We seem to be getting
somewhere, slowly.

We talked about the simple example
\\[ X' = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) \\\\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix} \\]
And "using the physicists approach." (Figure out the form of your solution, but
then use data to find all the constants, rather than tracking a nasty computation
to find them.)

Then we talked about our damped harmonic oscillator, and found that one case was
"overdamped," and another direction was "forced" (solutions _grow_ with time).

Do more of this. Next time will be our short wrap up meeting.
