#### Math 3425, Fall 2016


### Course Description

Elementary theory and applications of first order differential equations; introduction to numerical techniques of solving differential equations; solutions of nth order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

### Learning Objectives

Students will learn to

1. model situations involving change using differential equations.

2. use a variety of standard techniques to solve equations analytically, including the theory of linear systems of equations with constant coefficients.

3. use geometric models of several different kinds to do qualitative analysis.

4. use numerical methods to approximation solutions to differential equations.

5. communicate clearly about mathematics using precision and concision.


### Assessment:

Course grades will be based on six assessments: three exams (2 midterm and 1 final)
and three projects. Each of these will involve multiple learning objectives.

Assessment items will be well-described in advance, including specifications for
constitutes acceptable work. Work that does not meet standards will be given one
one chance for revision in a time frame negotiated with the instructor.

### Dates to Watch:

* Fourth Week of Class: Project 1
* Fifth Week of Class: Exam 1
* Ninth Week of Class: Project 2
* Tenth Week of Class: Exam 2
* Final Exam Week: Final Exam and Final Project

### Resources:

There are so many books on differential equations, it is hard to know where to begin.
It seems impossible to know all of the possible texts, but there are several which
seem worth sharing.

Online, Free Texts:

  * An in-progress, free, online book: [http://faculty.sfasu.edu/judsontw/ode/html/index.html]()
  * Another free online book, available as a PDF from [http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/trench-de/]()

Traditional Books of Interest:

  * Simmons, Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes, 2nd Ed.
  * Boyce and DiPrima, Elementary Differential Equations
  * Polking, Boggess and Arnold, Ordinary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems

Books that also include more of a dynamical point of view

  * Strogatz, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos
  * Hirsch, Smale, and Devaney, Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an
  Introduction to Chaos

An advanced book on the traditional material, beloved by mathematicians, but pretty hard

  * Arnol'd, Ordinary Differential Equations

And One for the Graduate Students: All Theory, No Exercises

  * Hurewicz, Lectures on Ordinary Differential Equations  

### Student Academic Accommodations

Please address any special needs or special accommodations with me at the beginning of the semester or as soon as you become aware of your needs. Those seeking accommodations based on disabilities should obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) form from Student Disability Services (SDS) (phone 319-273-2677, for deaf or hard of hearing, use Relay 711). SDS is located on the top floor of the Student Health Center, Room 103.
