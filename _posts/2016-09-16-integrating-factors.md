title: Integrating Factors
---

We talked about how most equations aren't going to be exact, but sometimes we can
be clever and multiply through by a new factor which turns the equation into
an exact (and hence solvable) system.

In fact, we saw that a _solvable_ equation has to have such an "integrating factor."

We also considered how one might find such a crazy thing.
