title: Null clines, and directional analysis in the phase plane
---

Well, the spell-checker in my text editor likes "null clines" but not "nullclines."
That settles the debate we had during class. That is, it settles the internal
debate I had with myself quietly all through class.

We introduce the idea of doing qualitative directional analysis in the phase
plane for 2d autonomous, but nonlinear, systems. We looked at a simple example in
detail: first by hand, later using the computer for plots.
