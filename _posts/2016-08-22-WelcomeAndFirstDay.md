title: Welcome, and First Day
---

Welcome to Math 3425/5425. I hope you enjoyed our m&amp;m's activity. It contained
most of the modeling steps I want to become familiar to you when dealing with a
situation where some sort of _change_ is occurring.

  * Consider the assumptions
  * make a model of _the way that change is happening_
  * explore the model numerically
  * explore the model qualitatively
  * check your results against experimental data
  * reconsider the whole project, what works and what needs improvement?

It was good we got to meet each other. I have promptly forgotten all of your names,
but we will start over on Wednesday and I am sure we will all be friends soon enough.

## For Wednesday

Your assignment for Wednesday is as follows:

Think of an interest you have that is connected to differential equations in some way.
Find a differential equation that helps describe some phenomenon you might care about.
I want you to figure out some basics about your equation and write a 1-2 page paper
to hand in on Wednesday. (Please type it up. We want to _read_ them.)

  * What is your equation?
  * Why do you think it might be interesting?
  * What are the variables, and what do they represent?
  * Are there any parameters in your equation? What might it mean if you varied them?
  * Can you say anything about the _type_ of differential equation you have?

Be prepared to give a short (less than 5 minute) presentation sharing your discoveries
with the class, and to turn in your paper. I want to collect some examples for later work
and share with the class.
