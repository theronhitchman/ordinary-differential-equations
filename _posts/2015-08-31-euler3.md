title: Euler's Method, implemented

---

We discussed our implementations of Euler's method. Most of you used Matlab. at least one person
used Mathematica. I used Python, and if you care, you can find it in [this SageMathCloud worksheet][tj-euler]. It should be easy to download and copy into an SMC project if you want to play wit it.

We saw that Euler's Method was pretty good for our first toy problem, but had trouble with our second toy problem. We want something better!

Then I talked at you all for a bit. I discussed how to motivate Euler's method, and how we can use these motivations to think up improvements. This brought up

  * Heun's Improved Euler method, which uses a simple predictor-corrector scheme inspired by the
    trapezoid rule for computing an integral.
  * The basics of using a "multi-term" method, where instead of truncating the Taylor polynomial
    for $f(x,y)$ at the constant term, we keep the first order information, too.

Both of these should lead to improvements in accuracy, though the trade off is either computational speed, or the necessity of computing a derivative of $f$.

### Assignment for Wednesday, September 2:

Implement each of these two new methods and try them out on our toy problems. Use a variety of
step sizes and see how much better you can do.

Also, read the stuff I handed out today. You will find it helpful.
