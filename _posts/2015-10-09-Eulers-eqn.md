title: Regular Singular Points &amp; Euler's equation
---

Today we discussed the ideas of "ordinary points", "regular singular points," and
"irregular singular points." These are all descriptors for points as they relate
to a second order homogeneous linear equation

\\[
y'' + P(x)y' + Q(x) y = 0.
\\]

We want to find a way to study such equations when \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have
rather mild singularities. (The regular singular points.) To motivate the basic
idea, we looked at Euler's equation

\\[
y'' + \dfrac{p}{x} y' + \dfrac{q}{x^2} = 0
\\]

where \\(p, q\\) are constants. As is typical with Euler, the solution method is
to use a clever change of variables: \\( z = \log x\\).

#### Homework for Monday, 12 October

1. Check that the constant coefficient second order homogeneous linear equation

\\[ y'' + a y' + b y = 0\\]

has solutions \\( y = e^{m_1 x} \\) and \\( y = e^{m_2 x} \\) where \\(m_1 \neq m_2 \\)
are the roots of the associated quadratic \\( m^2 + A m + B = 0\\).

In the case that the quadratic has a double root \\(m\\), check that the solutions are
\\( y = e^{m x} \\) and \\( y = x e^{m x}\\).

2. Use the basic power series method to study Legendre's equation
\\[ (1-x^2) y'' -2x y' + p(p+1) y = 0 \\]
at the ordinary point \\(x=0\\). If it helps, assume that \\(p\\) is a positive
integer, but think about what would happen if it isn't!
