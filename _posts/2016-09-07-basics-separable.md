title: ODE Basics &amp; Separable equations
---

I lectured today. It was weird. Anyway, I talked about these important things:

  * An outline for our study of first order equations in the next few weeks.
  * What is an ODE? and what does it mean to solve one? The difference between
  \\( F(x,y,y')=0 \\) and \\(y' = f(x,y) \\)?
  * Separable equations
  * implicitly defined functions and families of curves as level sets
  * the example of \\(y' = y/x\\) with its solution \\( y = Cx\\).

Next time we will finish our talk about implicitly defined solutions, and then move
on to _linear_ equations.

### For Friday

Do some reading.
