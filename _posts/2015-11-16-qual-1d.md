title: Qualitative Analysis in 1 Dimension
---

We discussed the way to do qualitative analysis of systems of the form
\\[
y' = f(y).
\\]
Note that this is the general form of a 1 variable, autonomous ordinary differential
equation.

The new key words were: _phase line_, _vector field_, _fixed point_, _stable_, _unstable_, and _half-stable_.

I asked you to look at this example as some light homework:
\\[
y' = sin(y)
\\]
