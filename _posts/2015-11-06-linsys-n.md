title: Linear Systems Technique
---

We decided to have an exam on Friday, Nov 13, in class. Coverage is: Laplace
Transform methods, power series methods, and systems.

We discussed some details of how to solve first order linear systems of ordinary
differential equations with constant coefficients. In particular, we talked about
things that look like this:
\\[ X' = AX + F(t) \\]

We added the following example as "one we should be able to solve."
\\[ X' = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) \\\\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix} \\]
