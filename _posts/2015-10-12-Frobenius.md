title: Method of Froebenius
---

Today I showed you the "method of Froebenius" for finding series style solutions
to second order homogeneous linear differential equations at regular singular points.
I handed out [my notes, including the homework for next time][Froebenius], because
the notation is a mess, but there is not really much of a new idea here.

#### For Wednesday, 14 October

Do the two exercises listed at the end of the notes linked above.

Also, revisit the homework listed in the last post. On Wednesday we will discuss
the details.
