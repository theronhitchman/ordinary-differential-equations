title: The Theorem of Picard
---

We talked about the "Fundamental Theorem of Differential Equations" today, which
sometimes goes by the name of "Picard's Theorem" or "Picard-Lindelof Theorem."

Then we talked a bit about how to use power series methods to solve an ODE.
I did the example of \\(y'= y, y(0)=5\\) and asked you to try this one for next
time \\(y'=y^2, y(1)=2\\).

We also previewed Picard's Iteration method.

### For next time


Solve the initial value problem \\(y'=y^2, y(1)=2\\) by looking for a function
in power series form \\( y(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (x-1)^2 \\).
