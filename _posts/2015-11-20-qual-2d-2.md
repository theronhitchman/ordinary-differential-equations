title: More on Linear 2D Systems
---

Today we finished the trace-determinant plane picture for classifying the qualitative
behavior of solutions near the fixed point at the origin in a 2D linear system
\\(X' = AX\\).

We even talked a little about how the degenerate cases fit in between the open
regions, which is pretty cool to watch.

Have a good break. I'll send a copy of Strogatz's paper if I can find it.
