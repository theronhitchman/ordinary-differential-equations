title: Week Three Wrap Up

---

Week Three was a short week, and it didn't have me in it. Dr Wood covered for
me as the class started the study of methods of solving classes of first order
differential equations written in explicit standard form:

\[
y' = f(x,y), \quad y(x_0) = y_0
\]

#### Monday 7 September

No meeting for the Labor Day Holiday

#### Wednesday 9 September

A discussion of:

* How to interpret a differential equation in _differential form_ like so:

\[
M(x,y)\,dx + N(x,y)\,dy = 0
\]

* Solving _Separable Equations_.

* Solving _Homogeneous Equations_.

#### Friday 11 September

* Solving _Exact Equations_.
