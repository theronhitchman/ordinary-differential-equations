title: Qualitative Analysis for Budworm Model
---

Today we started our analysis of the spruce budworm model using qualitative tools,
especially the "vector field on a line" model. We found that there is an interesting
dependence of the number of equilibria on the parameters \\(r, q\\).

We discussed ways of handling the details using algebra and using geometry. On Monday,
we will use the geometric approach.

### Coming Up

On Monday I will hand out the next project.
(That is, I will hand it out Monday if I haven't sent it to you over the weekend.)
The project will be due a week or so after that.

We will have our second exam on Friday, two weeks from today.
