title: Exam Day 1

First Exam today. I hope it went well for all of you. I will try to get them
marked for Monday. (I almost regret typing that. It is not a promise, but I am
going to try.)

Next week we will look into _power series methods_. This is especially useful
for studying types of equations that come up in mathematical physics. We will
have *many* classical examples of interesting ODEs to choose from:

* Legendre's equation
* Airy's equation
* Bessel's equation
* Hermite's equation
* The hypergeometric equation
* and many more...
