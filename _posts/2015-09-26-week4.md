title: Week Four Wrap Up

During Week Four, we continued our study of methods for finding analytic,
closed-form solutions to first order differential equations.

#### Monday 14 September

We spent time trying to recap some of what happened the previous week. This included time to discuss your work on assignments about Picard Iteration, Separable equations, and exact equations.

#### Wednesday 16 September

I canceled class due to lingering issues.

#### Friday 18 September
