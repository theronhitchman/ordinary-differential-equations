title: Series Discussion
---

Today we talked about the homework I have assigned about basic power series
methods and the method of Froebenius.

Next time we will start our discussion of using vector and matrix techniques
to solve systems of ordinary differential equations, or even just higher
order equations, in a manner similar to how we solve the equation
\\[ y' = f(y,x) \\]
The difference is that \\(y, y'\\) and \\(f\\) will be vector quantities.
